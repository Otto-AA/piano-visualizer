It just looks so light and free... =D But I needed a while to realize, that even birds have to learn flying at some point in their life.

So from the beginning I tried to make something that fits to \\\"The Soldier\\\" by e.g. using 3 simple accords (Gm, F, Eb) and then adding one out of the scale (D) for showing a monotone, but also strange life. Also I tried to represent some guns from 2:12 - 2:36 and to keep a very consistent, hard beat after the beginning.","date":"05_10_2017","design":"_custom_A-A_The-Soldier","files":{"mp3":true,"mid":true,"pdf":true},"YT":"C0ZzjUBoNhI"}]
